# About

Artist brand Website is a website that could be used by an artist to publish events, news, sell music, and even stream embedded youtube videos. It is made of NodeJS and Express.js for the backend, ReactJS with Redux for the frontend, and MongoDB for data storage and for the payment, I have used Flutterwave

This is a [official website](https://musici.netlify.app/) and [Here](https://github.com/Gilbertelnino/artist-shop) there is shop repo
